# CMDC_Chaotic_Multiplayer_Decisions_and_Cheats
The mod adds to HOI4 multiplayer games a player-only, one-pick-only decision system that grants an absurd hidden advantage via invisible ideas/spirits.
Factions may decide a strategy where countries will select specific role to play accordingly.
All effects can be canceled and pushed back if the opposition pick the correct counter strategy. This is a rock, paper, scissors game.
Selecting a decision is irreversible: you can wait and study your opponents or you can all-in istantly on a strategy.

Minimum game size should be 5vs5 nations. Suggested for 10vs10 for maximum in depth roles.

Unbalanced amount of nations could break the game. 
Suggested rule is maximum of 20% team sizes difference.
